- cool
busy UI
The tutorial is good but a lot of “next” clicking

The charges flow in the opposite of the arrows, im not sure whether this shouldb ehappening or not (is it positive charges moving or negatives? and which current do the arrows show?

Arrows seem to show conventional current, electrons are moving. maybe just make that a little more clear

Overall very nice just a lot going on. Not bad UI though. Maybe add some dropdowns. 

Saving doesn’t seem to work


Add more presets?

Simulating flow is cool but adds a burst of particles at the begining and then a steady slower flow after which is a little confusing

I am not at this level of Electrostatics yet.
Not sure what anything does.
I think
